## Agent Capabilities Matrix

Mode is determined by the agent's tool set: agents without Write/Edit tools are effectively **read-only** (plan mode); agents with Write/Edit operate in **acceptEdits** mode where file changes are auto-accepted but Bash still requires approval.

| Agent | Model | Mode | Tools | Memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product Manager | opus | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, AskUserQuestion | project |
| Architect | opus | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch | project |
| Backend Developer | sonnet | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | — |
| Frontend Developer | sonnet | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | — |
| Database Engineer | sonnet | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | — |
| API Designer | sonnet | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch | — |
| Tech Lead | opus | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | project |
| Code Reviewer | opus | plan | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | project |
| Test Engineer | sonnet | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | — |

| Requirements Analyst | sonnet | acceptEdits | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion | project |

## Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Chain
Tasks execute in strict order. Each task's output feeds the next.
```
A → B → C → D
```
Use `blockedBy` to enforce ordering.

### Parallel Fan-Out
Independent tasks run concurrently, followed by a synchronization point.
```
A → [B, C, D] (parallel) → E
```
B, C, D each have `blockedBy: [A]`. E has `blockedBy: [B, C, D]`.

### Review Gate
Implementation followed by mandatory review before proceeding.
```
implement → [code-reviewer, security-engineer] (parallel) → proceed only if pass
```
If reviewers flag Critical issues, loop back to implementation.

For SDD plan review gates (Phases 2, 5, 8, 10), the orchestrator also participates as a parallel reviewer for cross-cutting issues — see `review-governance.md` § Orchestrator Review.

### Iterative Loop
Profile → implement → verify cycle, repeated until targets are met.
```
performance-engineer (profile) → implementer (fix) → performance-engineer (verify)
```
Repeat if metrics not met.

## Planning Principles

When orchestrating multi-agent work, apply these principles:

- **When in doubt, include a review gate.** Code-reviewer and security-engineer are read-only and cheap.
- **Prefer parallel execution** when tasks are independent — don't create unnecessary sequential chains.
- **Right-size the plan** — a single file change doesn't need 7 agents. Match plan complexity to request complexity.
- **Include context propagation** — each task description should include what prior steps will have produced.
- **Apply chunking heuristics** — each task should touch 3-5 files max, have a machine-verifiable exit condition, and be completable in ~1 hour. Split tasks that violate these limits.
- **Every task needs a verifiable exit condition** in its description (test command, type-check, endpoint assertion). "Implementation complete" is not verifiable.
- **Prefer spec-first** for work involving new data shapes, APIs, or integration points — the cost of specifying before building is always less than the cost of reworking after.

## Session Continuity

At the start of any session, check for `plans/sdd-state.md`. If it exists, read it to understand current SDD progress before asking the user what to do next. This file is the authoritative record of which SDD phase the project is in and what has been completed.

Update `plans/sdd-state.md` at every phase transition — phase completion, review gate pass, consensus gate. See `workflow-patterns` skill § SDD State Tracking for the template and update protocol.

## Cost Tiers

| Tier | Model | Agents | Use When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **High** | opus | Product Manager, Architect, Tech Lead, Code Reviewer | Product strategy, architecture, technical design, code review — errors in planning and review cascade through everything |
| **Standard** | sonnet | All others | Implementation, analysis, project management, documentation — quality sufficient for the task |

Opus is reserved for decisions and reviews with high blast radius: product direction, architecture, technical design (plan quality), and code review (review rigor). All implementation, analysis, and project management work uses sonnet to optimize cost.

## Agent Memory (`memory: project`)

Nine agents have `memory: project` enabled: Product Manager, Architect, Tech Lead, Code Reviewer, Security Engineer, Project Manager, SRE Engineer, Technical Writer, and Requirements Analyst. This means they retain context across sessions for the current project.

**What agents should remember:**

*Agent-specific knowledge:*
- Product vision, personas, success metrics, and feature priorities (Product Manager)
- Architectural decisions and their rationale (Architect)
- Feature-level technical patterns, interface conventions, and implementation approaches that worked well (Tech Lead)
- Recurring code quality patterns — both positive and negative (Code Reviewer)
- Known vulnerabilities, accepted risks, and security exceptions (Security Engineer)
- Estimation accuracy, velocity patterns, and dependency structures (Project Manager)
- SLO targets, incident history, capacity baselines, and operational patterns (SRE Engineer)
- Project terminology, documentation structure, and style preferences (Technical Writer)
- Stakeholder preferences, domain rules, and requirements history (Requirements Analyst)

*Cross-cutting — all memory-enabled agents should track:*
- **Stakeholder preferences** — Decision patterns, risk tolerance, scope tendencies, communication style, technology biases. When you observe a consistent preference across interactions (e.g., "stakeholder always defers nice-to-haves to Phase 2", "prefers conservative technology choices"), record it. Over time, this lets agents anticipate preferences rather than re-asking. The canonical record lives in the root `CLAUDE.md` Stakeholder Preferences table — update it when a pattern is clear.

**What agents should NOT remember:**
- Transient debugging state or temporary workarounds
- Content of secret/credential values encountered during sessions
- Personal preferences of individual developers (use `settings.local.json` for those)

**When agents should write memory:**

Agents with `memory: project` should write to their memory file at the end of any session where they:
- Made or discovered a significant decision (architecture choice, design pattern, stakeholder preference)
- Encountered a recurring pattern (positive or negative) worth capturing for future sessions
- Completed a planning artifact that downstream agents will need to reference
- Discovered a constraint or gotcha that isn't documented elsewhere

Memory is only valuable if agents proactively write it. The "what to remember" list above is not sufficient on its own -- agents must actively persist their learnings before their session ends.

Memory builds up naturally over sessions. Agents with memory become more effective as the project matures because they can reference prior decisions and patterns without re-reading every file.
